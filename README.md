# CAP - Example Rust Empty Project

This is an empty Rust boilerplate that the team at [CAP](https://cap.ooo/) has built to help showcase how to integrate CAP to a new NFT/Token project.

You can clone this or fork it to start your own project, and **follow this guide on our Documentation**: https://docs.cap.ooo/integrate-cap/getting-started/
